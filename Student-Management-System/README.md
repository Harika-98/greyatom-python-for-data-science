### Project Overview

 This Student Management System using python programming is used to prepare the list of students and marks scored by them in their examinations. Adding the additional students in the list and removing unwanted names in the list is also shown. By creating a dictionary having students name and their particular subject marks, we are finding the topper from them who got maximum marks in mathematics subject and print their name by splitting the full name to get surname followed by first name in the certificate. 


### Learnings from the project
